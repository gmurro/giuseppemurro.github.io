### About 🧐

Hi, my name is Giuseppe Murro and this portfolio was created to showcase my projects and experiences as a developer . It was built using Jekyll, a static site generator, and is hosted on GitHub Pages 🌐.

The portfolYOU theme was a great starting point for me, with its clean and modern design and customizable features such as:

- A responsive layout for optimal viewing on any device 📱
