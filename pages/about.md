# **About Me** <span><a href="/assets/cv.pdf" class="btn btn-info" id="cv-button">CV</a></span>
:wave: Hi there! 

:pushpin: I'm **{{ site.author.name }}**, a Data Scientist working at Treatwell, a beauty booking platform located in Milan, where I'm currently based. 

:mortar_board: My interest in Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning led me to pursue a Master's degree in AI at the "Alma Mater Studiorum" University in Bologna, which I completed in December 2022 with a thesis in NLP graduating with full marks and honours. Prior to this, I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at University of Bari, located in my beloved Puglia where I raised and spent my teen-age years. 

:airplane: During my studies, I had the opportunity to spend five months in Amsterdam for an Erasmus exchange program, where I took courses in Reinforcement learning and significantly improved my English proficiency while also gaining cross-cultural experience. 
The Netherlands is a vibrant and cosmopolitan country with a rich history and culture. I thoroughly enjoyed immersing myself in it during my time there.

:dizzy: My enthusiasm for coding and AI is what motivates me to continue learning and growing in these areas and to pursue new challenges.
I truly believe that AI will have a significant impact on our lives in the near future, and I am excited to be part of this journey.
